* Edit the external.json file by providing the correct path to the folder where input data is located.
* **pip install transformers** (install all other basic requirements as well) 
* For training run - **python3 saarthi_train.py --config "external.json"**
* For inference and getting F1 scores run - **python3 saarthi_test.py --config "external.json"**
* See the colab notebook to see implementation of these commands. Refer documentation to get more insights on each file.

See the drive here for all the outputs after running both the python files. You can directly downjload the pretrained model weights from here and use in your inference. [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pbwOXy5VvTubH32WBGir2GlTMfxp6xcR?usp=sharing)
